# i2t

The i2t dataset is a simple, comma-separated file containing IP address ranges and corresponding time zones.  This data is intended to be used to provide best-guess timezone approximation (e.g. for websites) based on a user's IP address.  The i2p data itself is based on factual data from a combination of other sources.
